                    <p>I've had a deep crush on how the internet works, and its almost a miracle creating this page. I love afang soup and fufu. Basically, any food that tastes nice. I adore Dan Brown's books, as he made me fall in love with reading.
                    Technology has become a sort of help for me to live my dreams. Cloud engineering seems like a new passion for me, but I think cybersecurity is where my heart is going to.
                    </p>
                <p>I love volunteering. I'm currently a member of a charity outreach where we go into villages to share the gospel and handle medical for the villagers. Oh, I'm a medical personnel.
